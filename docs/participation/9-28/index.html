        Out of the three layouts implemented, I liked the flex-box layout the most because it was easy to use. However,
        I
        can see how the grid layout could be useful in many other more complex situations. The layouts in general were a
        little difficult to figure out at first, but I think I'm starting to get the hang of it.
